About Me

### Content
I'm a passionate full-stack developer with a strong foundation in both frontend and backend technologies. My journey in software development began with curiosity about how websites work, and it has evolved into a deep passion for creating innovative digital solutions.

I specialize in building responsive web applications using modern frameworks like React, Next.js, and Node.js. I'm also experienced in mobile development with React Native and have worked with various databases and cloud services.

My approach to development is user-centric, focusing on creating intuitive interfaces and robust backend systems. I believe in writing clean, maintainable code and staying up-to-date with the latest industry trends and best practices.
