# Performance Optimization Guide

This document outlines strategies implemented to improve the performance of the portfolio website and reduce lag during scrolling.

## Current Optimizations

1. **Component Modularization**
   - Split the monolithic code (1000+ lines) into separate component files
   - Each section is now its own component, making the code more maintainable
   - Components: `HeroSection`, `AboutSection`, `ProjectsSection`, `ExperienceSection`, etc.

2. **Animation Optimizations**
   - Reduced number of simultaneous animations
   - Used `viewport={{ once: true }}` to only trigger animations once
   - Added proper exit animations to clean up resources

3. **Rendering Optimizations**
   - Using `useEffect` cleanup functions to prevent memory leaks
   - Simplified components by removing unnecessary state and effects

## Additional Recommendations

1. **Further Reduce Animation Complexity**
   - Consider removing the floating background elements on mobile 
   - Simplify gradient animations which are CPU-intensive
   - Replace some `framer-motion` animations with CSS animations where possible

2. **Image Optimizations**
   - Use Next.js Image component with proper sizes (already implemented)
   - Consider further optimizing profile image and project images
   - Add proper width and height to all images

3. **Code Splitting and Lazy Loading**
   - Consider implementing lazy loading for sections far down the page
   - Use Next.js dynamic imports for components that aren't immediately visible

4. **Reduce CSS Complexity**
   - Minimize the use of blur effects which are GPU-intensive
   - Replace shadow/blur combinations with simpler alternatives
   - Consider reducing the complexity of gradient effects

5. **Performance Monitoring**
   - Use Lighthouse to identify additional performance bottlenecks
   - Consider implementing performance monitoring with tools like Sentry

## Implementation Notes

The main change made was splitting the 1000+ line `page.tsx` file into multiple component files:

- `MatrixText.tsx` - Handles the matrix scramble effect
- `HeroSection.tsx` - Contains the hero section with profile image
- `AboutSection.tsx` - Contains the about section with skills
- `ProjectsSection.tsx` - Displays the project cards
- `ExperienceSection.tsx` - Shows the experience timeline

This modular approach makes the code more maintainable and helps limit re-renders to only the components that need updating, rather than re-rendering the entire page.
